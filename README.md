1. Bike ID count by month

I wanted to see about the change in weather and how over time it may affect the number of BikeIDs which would show in the data. 
I can see they diminish in colder months which makes sense in that climate. 

2. Trip Duration and Birth year
I can see with this line chart that there is a significant spike for a certain birth year. I would not have expected to see this increase for this particular year.
3. Popular Time of the day to ride.
With this chart I was a little less surprised to see the spike at 8AM and 6PM as these are the times people are going and coming from work. 
4. Trip Duration & Bikeid count over time Dashboard.
I wanted to bring together these two charts to compare these over the second half of 2019. Both trip duration and Bikeid went down coorelating with the seasons. The colder it got the less people wanted to ride. 
5. Average Trip Duration over time
Looking at this chart we can see from June that it is very high. This is likely due to both increase with kids on summer break and the nice weather. Tourists being in the area may also contribute to the high number in warm seasons. It drops significantly at the end of the year.
